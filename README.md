# Loan_Default
##### Logistic Regression Classifiers

### Context and Data
On this project, i worked on a data set of loans issued to small businesses in California, initially provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration and further cleaned by Min Li, Amy Mickel, and Stanley Taylor. For more details on the data and its history, read [“Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?”](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2018.1434342) A Large Dataset with Class Assignment Guidelines by Li, Mickel, adn Taylor, published 2018 in the Journal of Statistics Education.

The project goal is to predict loan defaults utilizing Logistic Regression Classifier, to help the lender estimate loan risk. For classification purposes, we will consider a loan to be ‘high risk’ if the classifier predicts default, and ‘low risk’ otherwise.
